00:00:00,108 --> 00:00:01,713
- Hello and welcome to chapter 9.

2
00:00:01,713 --> 00:00:04,382
Now we're going to talk
about Python Dictionaries.

3
00:00:04,382 --> 00:00:07,994
Python Dictionaries are probably the thing

4
00:00:07,994 --> 00:00:11,732
that most programmers love
the most about Python,

5
00:00:11,732 --> 00:00:13,251
because they're very powerful.

6
00:00:13,251 --> 00:00:15,229
They're like a little in-memory database.

7
00:00:15,229 --> 00:00:17,430
It's the second of our
kinds of collections

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,849
and probably the best collection.

9
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:22,152
To review what a collection is,

10
00:00:22,152 --> 00:00:24,699
it is a situation where we
are going to have a variable,

11
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:26,571
like a list, or a dictionary,

12
00:00:26,571 --> 00:00:29,319
and we can put multiple
pieces of information in,

13
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:31,595
rather than a single piece of information.

14
00:00:31,595 --> 00:00:33,782
And, of course, prior to collections,

15
00:00:33,782 --> 00:00:35,470
we would put something into X

16
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,611
and then we would put
something else into x

17
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:39,145
and it would be overwritten.

18
00:00:39,145 --> 00:00:43,313
And, now with lists we can
upend things on to the end.

19
00:00:43,313 --> 00:00:47,443
And, so if we compare
lists and dictionaries,

20
00:00:47,443 --> 00:00:50,919
the list is sort of the
organized version of collections.

21
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:52,942
Everything stays in order,

22
00:00:52,942 --> 00:00:54,881
you add something it
always adds to the end,

23
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:57,294
you take something it
sort of compacts itself,

24
00:00:57,294 --> 00:01:01,125
it's zero through n-1 where
n is the number of items.

25
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:04,232
And, so it's very organized,
kind of like a Pringles,

26
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:08,174
where the potato chips are nicely stacked.

27
00:01:08,174 --> 00:01:10,240
Dictionaries are messier.

28
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,291
You can put things into dictionaries,

29
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:16,566
there's no real sense of
order in dictionaries,

30
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:17,905
everything has a key.

31
00:01:17,905 --> 00:01:19,390
So, you sort of throw things in

32
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,681
and they sort of mix
around in there somehow,

33
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,444
and you pull things out based on the key.

34
00:01:23,444 --> 00:01:27,489
It's like you sort of stick a label on it

35
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:29,191
where you say, okay,

36
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:31,274
I'm gonna take this thing

37
00:01:32,863 --> 00:01:36,134
and I'm going to put Chuck on it

38
00:01:36,134 --> 00:01:37,884
and I'm going to take

39
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:43,233
these sunglasses with the Chuck label

40
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:45,399
and I'm gonna throw it
in to the dictionary

41
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:47,176
and I'm gonna like,
hey give me back Chuck,

42
00:01:47,176 --> 00:01:48,732
then I'm like oh, here's your sunglasses.

43
00:01:48,732 --> 00:01:50,764
Cause, you mark everything,

44
00:01:50,764 --> 00:01:52,961
this is like the key,

45
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:54,042
this is the value.

46
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:56,479
I took a pair of sunglasses
and I threw it in.

47
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,017
So, it's kind of like a purse

48
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:00,101
or it's sort of like a mess.

49
00:02:00,101 --> 00:02:02,590
So the idea is, you have these labels

50
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,816
that you put on everything
that you're going to throw in.

51
00:02:05,816 --> 00:02:10,213
Like, I'm gonna put, oops
it won't stick to my keys.

52
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,465
What else have I got here?

53
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,432
Then I stick a label on my pen.

54
00:02:15,432 --> 00:02:17,322
Chuck label and I'm going to store my pen

55
00:02:17,322 --> 00:02:20,757
in my dictionary with a Chuck label.

56
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:24,929
And so, it's like having a
purse or a bag or a backpack,

57
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:26,517
where you have things labeled

58
00:02:26,517 --> 00:02:29,532
and you can throw things in and label them

59
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:31,567
and you can shout into your bag and say,

60
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:34,194
give me the calculator, give me the candy,

61
00:02:34,194 --> 00:02:36,741
or whatever it is that
you have labeled them.

62
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:38,283
You have to come up with the labels

63
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,012
and then you can use the
labels to get things back out.

64
00:02:41,012 --> 00:02:43,872
And, like I said they're
probably the most powerful thing

65
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,044
and they're basically a concept

66
00:02:46,044 --> 00:02:48,407
that's generally referred
to as Associative Arrays,

67
00:02:48,407 --> 00:02:51,468
which means they're like lists
but they have these keys.

68
00:02:51,468 --> 00:02:53,615
And, the associative means,

69
00:02:53,615 --> 00:02:55,835
the association between a key and a value.

70
00:02:55,835 --> 00:02:58,274
Where is, in the list, there's
a position in the value.

71
00:02:58,274 --> 00:03:00,812
A position is less
powerful and less flexible.

72
00:03:00,812 --> 00:03:03,141
Most modern programming languages have

73
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,929
this notion of associative arrays.

74
00:03:04,929 --> 00:03:06,928
If they don't, they're sort of unpopular,

75
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:08,833
because once you get using them,

76
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,583
you're like, whoa they're so powerful.

77
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,060
If you ever find yourself in a language

78
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,855
that doesn't' have them, you'll freak out.

79
00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:17,477
They can have different
names like, property maps

80
00:03:17,477 --> 00:03:19,850
or Hash Maps or Property Bags,

81
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,515
depending on the language you're using,

82
00:03:21,515 --> 00:03:23,068
but they all are the same thing.

83
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:25,870
They're key value pairs.

84
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,805
So, the idea of a dictionary is that,

85
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:29,978
or the idea of any collection,

86
00:03:29,978 --> 00:03:31,727
is putting more than one thing in.

87
00:03:31,727 --> 00:03:33,282
And, then the difference is that

88
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:36,430
you have ways of indexing it.

89
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,913
So, this basically line says,

90
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:39,477
let's make ourselves a dictionary

91
00:03:39,477 --> 00:03:42,138
just like we constructed an empty list.

92
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,594
And, I want to start
twelve into this dictionary

93
00:03:44,594 --> 00:03:46,659
and I want to label it, money.

94
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,226
And so, on the left hand
side, when we use this money,

95
00:03:49,226 --> 00:03:51,564
that's the label that
we're going to give it.

96
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,392
And so, twelve is being
placed in the dictionary

97
00:03:53,392 --> 00:03:54,929
that's like taking the twelve,

98
00:03:54,929 --> 00:03:57,388
throwing into the dictionary
with the label of money.

99
00:03:57,388 --> 00:03:58,768
I can't, yeah.

100
00:03:58,768 --> 00:04:00,730
Three is going in with the label of candy.

101
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,597
And, seventy-five is
going in with tissues.

102
00:04:02,597 --> 00:04:03,842
We say, what's in there?

103
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:05,097
And, there's no order to it

104
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:06,122
and sometimes it even,

105
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:08,529
the order can even change
inside of the dictionary.

106
00:04:08,529 --> 00:04:10,103
Although, there are more advanced versions

107
00:04:10,103 --> 00:04:12,523
of dictionaries that
maintain some kind of order,

108
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:14,232
but for now, let's just not worry

109
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:15,647
about the ordering of them.

110
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:17,624
Um, if we say, what's in there?

111
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,566
You say, well there's
three things in there.

112
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:21,423
There is twelve, seventy-five, and three,

113
00:04:21,423 --> 00:04:22,804
and stored under the keys

114
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,706
money, tissues, and candy respectively.

115
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:28,923
We can ask, using the index operator,

116
00:04:28,923 --> 00:04:30,384
what is purse of candy,

117
00:04:30,384 --> 00:04:32,691
and that's like saying,
hey, give me back candy

118
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:36,818
and out comes the number
three which is that.

119
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,554
And, we can update stuff, so we can say

120
00:04:38,554 --> 00:04:41,668
go grab the candy version
and add two to it.

121
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:43,962
Make five and then store
that back into candy.

122
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:47,390
And, so now we see that
candy has been up to,

123
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,890
set up to be five.

124
00:04:50,427 --> 00:04:54,407
And, um, and so, if you
look at the difference

125
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:56,501
between lists and dictionaries,

126
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:59,769
They both can have new
items added to them.

127
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:01,054
We haven't talked a lot about deleting,

128
00:05:01,054 --> 00:05:02,865
but items can be deleted from them.

129
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:05,127
The difference is the indexing mechanism,

130
00:05:05,127 --> 00:05:07,168
how we look things up, how we store things

131
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:08,732
and how we look things up.

132
00:05:08,732 --> 00:05:11,407
So, we make an empty list,
we make an empty dictionary.

133
00:05:11,407 --> 00:05:12,759
We add twenty-one to the end

134
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,058
and we add 183 to the end,

135
00:05:14,058 --> 00:05:15,599
and we ask it, and it says oh,

136
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:18,573
position zero is twenty-one,
position one is 183.

137
00:05:18,573 --> 00:05:20,754
And, we don't see the positions
when you print it out,

138
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:21,809
because it's sort of implicit.

139
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:23,976
Here we're going to
mark twenty-one with age

140
00:05:23,976 --> 00:05:27,305
and stick it in, and mark 182
with course and stick it in.

141
00:05:27,305 --> 00:05:28,830
And, then we're going to print it out

142
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,200
and there we got course and age mapped.

143
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,519
And, we can add twenty-three
and stick it back in age

144
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,931
and that overwrites,

145
00:05:35,931 --> 00:05:37,901
so the twenty-one
becomes the twenty-three.

146
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:39,355
We can do the same thing in a list,

147
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:40,773
except we say lists of zero,

148
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,564
because in lists the indexing is position,

149
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:47,231
and so this twenty-one
becomes twenty-three.

150
00:05:48,363 --> 00:05:50,587
And, again, you just look at them

151
00:05:50,587 --> 00:05:53,224
and you can think of each
of these as pretty much

152
00:05:53,224 --> 00:05:54,851
doing roughly the same thing,

153
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:56,993
except the indexing mechanism.

154
00:05:56,993 --> 00:06:00,421
The values are the same
but the keys are different,

155
00:06:00,421 --> 00:06:02,647
so in lists, the keys
are always the position

156
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:04,118
and you don't get to assign those,

157
00:06:04,118 --> 00:06:06,513
other than the fact the order
in which you put them in,

158
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:08,399
implicitly assigns a position

159
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,806
and in dictionaries the key is a string.

160
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:14,135
You can actually use other things.

161
00:06:14,135 --> 00:06:16,585
I use strings a lot in this lecture

162
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,815
but that kind of keeps things simple

163
00:06:18,815 --> 00:06:20,276
until you get good at it.

164
00:06:20,276 --> 00:06:23,715
Um, you can actually use
numbers as the dictionary index

165
00:06:23,715 --> 00:06:25,661
or dictionary keys, if you want.

166
00:06:25,661 --> 00:06:27,631
But, the values are things you put in

167
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:30,035
and manage in those dictionaries.

168
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:34,163
So, we can, just like lists
we have dictionary literals

169
00:06:34,163 --> 00:06:36,880
and what's nice about
dictionary literals is that

170
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,104
they use the exact same
syntax as the printout.

171
00:06:40,104 --> 00:06:41,807
And, so it starts with a curly brace,

172
00:06:41,807 --> 00:06:43,042
ends with a curly brace,

173
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:45,122
then has a series of key, colon, value,

174
00:06:45,122 --> 00:06:46,466
key colon value,

175
00:06:46,466 --> 00:06:48,156
key colon value.

176
00:06:48,156 --> 00:06:50,180
And, this is sort of the
associative array bit,

177
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,108
we're associating one with the key Chuck,

178
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:55,222
we're associating forty-two with key Fred,

179
00:06:55,222 --> 00:06:57,990
we're associating Jan and a hundred.

180
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,345
Then we print it out it kind
of looks exactly the same.

181
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:02,587
So, the print statements
in Python are nice,

182
00:07:02,587 --> 00:07:04,535
in that you ask what's in a thing,

183
00:07:04,535 --> 00:07:06,934
you show the stuff and it
shows you in the syntax

184
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:08,656
that if you type that in to Python

185
00:07:08,656 --> 00:07:11,656
that would be how you do a constant.

186
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,380
And, if you just say, empty array,

187
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,408
you see me also do dict,
this is constructor,

188
00:07:19,408 --> 00:07:21,701
where you say make a new empty dictionary.

189
00:07:21,701 --> 00:07:23,574
This is an empty dictionary constant.

190
00:07:23,574 --> 00:07:26,374
These two things are pretty
much the exact same thing.

191
00:07:26,374 --> 00:07:29,124
This is a shortcut to doing this.

192
00:07:30,688 --> 00:07:34,449
The empty curly braces is a shortcut

193
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:36,366
to do the construction.

194
00:07:38,494 --> 00:07:40,681
So, up next we're going
to talk about sort of,

195
00:07:40,681 --> 00:07:43,622
one of the really common
applications of dictionaries.

196
00:07:43,622 --> 00:07:45,455
And, that is counting.

197
00:07:46,913 --> 00:07:49,330
