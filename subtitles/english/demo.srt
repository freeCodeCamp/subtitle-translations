1
00:00:00,259 --> 00:00:02,069
- [Charles] Hello and welcome
to Python for Everybody.

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:02,902
My name is Charles Severance

3
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:05,399
and I'm your instructor
and I wrote the textbook.

4
00:00:05,399 --> 00:00:09,566
And welcome to my website with
all of its extra materials.

5
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,217
So what I want to show you is 

6
00:00:12,217 --> 00:00:14,580
I want to show you the first assignment.

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,750
The Hello World assignment.

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,307
And how to complete the
Hello World assignment.

9
00:00:20,307 --> 00:00:22,084
Online using Python for Everybody.

10
00:00:22,084 --> 00:00:23,814
Using the Autograders.

11
00:00:23,814 --> 00:00:27,476
The Hello World assignment is part of the

12
00:00:27,476 --> 00:00:30,930
first chapter, the second
module in the course.

13
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,879
But the way it works is you
do not see the assignments

14
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:35,768
or the tracking

15
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:36,880
until you log in.

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,862
So I'm gonna log in.

17
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:40,978
We use Google for log in.

18
00:00:40,978 --> 00:00:43,440
Gotta work on a new one.

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,757
I've already logged in before

20
00:00:44,757 --> 00:00:47,717
otherwise it would have
me set up a profile.

21
00:00:47,717 --> 00:00:49,505
But Google log in goes really quick.

22
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:50,856
And so a couple things happen.

23
00:00:50,856 --> 00:00:53,128
You see Assignments which you're
tracking your assignments.

24
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:55,421
Discussion, which is a thread discussion.

25
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:56,681
But if you go back into Lessons

26
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,247
and go into the lesson
that I was in before,

27
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:02,016
you see this additional bit here.

28
00:01:02,016 --> 00:01:04,860
The Autograder to write Hello World.

29
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,874
So this is a graded assignment.

30
00:01:06,874 --> 00:01:08,912
And you can track your grades.

31
00:01:08,912 --> 00:01:10,758
I've been doing some of these assignments.

32
00:01:10,758 --> 00:01:13,121
This is sort of the grade
book for the course.

33
00:01:13,121 --> 00:01:14,448
And I'm not doing very well.

34
00:01:14,448 --> 00:01:17,045
But I have finished this Hello World

35
00:01:17,045 --> 00:01:19,005
and you can go straight from the Gradebook

36
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:21,660
to the Lesson that
contains the Assignment.

37
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,076
So now you go up to this Autograder.

38
00:01:25,076 --> 00:01:27,115
Basically the idea here,

39
00:01:27,115 --> 00:01:29,294
I'll hit Reset Code cause
I've already done this.

40
00:01:29,294 --> 00:01:31,103
You can always reset code.

41
00:01:31,103 --> 00:01:33,826
The idea is this is a Python interpreter

42
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:35,795
that actually runs in your browser.

43
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,066
It's quite a smart little thing

44
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:40,816
based on a piece of
technology called Skulpt.

45
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:45,175
It makes it so you can
do small Python programs.

46
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:47,684
This only kinda lasts for the
first 10 chapters of the book

47
00:01:47,684 --> 00:01:50,696
because then the Python
programs become too complex.

48
00:01:50,696 --> 00:01:53,017
I prefer that you don't
just use the Autograder

49
00:01:53,017 --> 00:01:54,648
but here we go.

50
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,471
So it's got three basic panels.

51
00:01:56,471 --> 00:01:58,614
This is your Code Editor.

52
00:01:58,614 --> 00:02:01,325
This is your Output when you run the code.

53
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:03,351
And this is what is the Assignment.

54
00:02:03,351 --> 00:02:04,680
So it's telling you

55
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,089
write a program that uses a
print statement that says,

56
00:02:07,089 --> 00:02:09,416
Hello World, as shown in desired output.

57
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:12,084
So you're supposed to match this, right.

58
00:02:12,084 --> 00:02:13,662
So this is your sample code

59
00:02:13,662 --> 00:02:15,787
and you can always go back
to the sample code by saying

60
00:02:15,787 --> 00:02:16,643
Reset Code.

61
00:02:16,643 --> 00:02:18,961
So I'll just press Check Code

62
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:20,795
so you can see what's going on.

63
00:02:20,795 --> 00:02:23,563
And it says, Oh you've got a syntax error.

64
00:02:23,563 --> 00:02:26,462
The errors are a little
different than real Python.

65
00:02:26,462 --> 00:02:29,129
This is kinda like Python light.

66
00:02:30,253 --> 00:02:31,650
It's not actually Python.

67
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,226
There are other ways that
you can run real Python

68
00:02:34,226 --> 00:02:36,847
interactively on the web.

69
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:39,726
But this is just enough
to get us started in

70
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:40,559
beginning things.

71
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:43,633
So this is "pringq is not allowed".

72
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:46,557
So I just change this,
of course, to print.

73
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:49,177
And let me make another first mistake.

74
00:02:49,177 --> 00:02:50,427
Hello my world.

75
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:52,351
And then I'm gonna do a Check Code.

76
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:53,734
Oh let me make a different mistake.

77
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:56,199
Let me just make this
be a capital Hello world

78
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,494
and put an exclamation

79
00:02:57,494 --> 00:03:00,350
as you see in some of my examples.

80
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,611
Now I'm gonna run it.

81
00:03:01,611 --> 00:03:03,481
This is syntactically correct code.

82
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:04,956
So I'm running it.

83
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:07,766
And so you see now here
it says Hello world!

84
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:08,968
Which means my code ran.

85
00:03:08,968 --> 00:03:10,286
I didn't have a bug.

86
00:03:10,286 --> 00:03:12,607
But now it's complaining
that I have a mismatch.

87
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:15,383
"Please correct your code and rerun."

88
00:03:15,383 --> 00:03:16,904
hello world

89
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:17,737
Hello world!

90
00:03:17,737 --> 00:03:19,301
And it's like I did it.

91
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:20,660
But the answer is you didn't.

92
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,889
Because the thing is
looking for an exact match.

93
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:25,972
So we have to change it a little bit.

94
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:30,650
And Check Code and it works.

95
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,162
Now it says "Grade updated on server".

96
00:03:33,162 --> 00:03:35,062
In this case I'm running
it in the context of

97
00:03:35,062 --> 00:03:37,312
www.pythonforeverybody.com.

98
00:03:38,324 --> 00:03:41,238
But this you may be running in Prosara

99
00:03:41,238 --> 00:03:44,489
or Sakai or Canvas or Moodle or Blackboard

100
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:46,132
or some other learning management system.

101
00:03:46,132 --> 00:03:47,078
So the top part here

102
00:03:47,078 --> 00:03:48,991
is your learning
management system perhaps.

103
00:03:48,991 --> 00:03:50,454
And this Autograder's here.

104
00:03:50,454 --> 00:03:53,098
And in that case it's still
sending the grade back to

105
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:55,211
wherever it was launched from.

106
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:57,080
So this uses a cool technology

107
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,647
that I've been researching for years

108
00:03:58,647 --> 00:04:00,445
called learning tools interoperability

109
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:02,739
It allows this grade to be sent to a

110
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:05,596
wide range of learning management systems.

111
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:07,790
So you don't have to see
all this other stuff.

112
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,903
And you don't have to be using this

113
00:04:09,903 --> 00:04:12,437
from my particular website.

114
00:04:12,437 --> 00:04:14,652
You can be using this from
any number of websites

115
00:04:14,652 --> 00:04:18,772
that use this Python For
Everybody as their Autograder

116
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:21,943
but then send the grades back
to the particular location

117
00:04:21,943 --> 00:04:23,475
that it needs to be.

118
00:04:23,475 --> 00:04:26,094
So that's probably more
than you needed to know.

119
00:04:26,094 --> 00:04:28,526
You can run this a couple times.

120
00:04:28,526 --> 00:04:30,134
And if it seems as though.

121
00:04:30,134 --> 00:04:32,200
And it's not a bad idea
once you're done with this

122
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,217
to go back to wherever
your grades are going.

123
00:04:35,217 --> 00:04:36,420
Like Assignments.

124
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,253
In this thing

125
00:04:37,253 --> 00:04:39,380
because this is my Python
for Everybody gradebook

126
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,391
to see where they're going.

127
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:42,057
But if you're in your own course,

128
00:04:42,057 --> 00:04:44,431
then you should go back to that course

129
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:47,130
to make sure that the
grade is falling back.

130
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:47,963
Okay?

131
00:04:49,078 --> 00:04:49,998
Thanks for listening.

132
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,249
That's using the Autograder
to write a Hello world program

133
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:54,868
for Python for Everybody.

134
00:04:54,868 --> 00:04:56,451
If you're a teacher

135
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:01,126
you can actually apply

136
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:04,795
to use this Autograder in your own class.

137
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:07,685
But that probably should
be for another video.

138
00:05:07,685 --> 00:05:09,282
I've talked long enough.

139
00:05:09,282 --> 00:05:11,532
Hope you found this useful.
